Robotics.py
the purpose of this document is to run the learning agent environment. 
There will be 2 reinforcement learning algorithms that will be used HER and PPO
To use HER comment out the PPO model learning line and to use PPO uncomment the line that initializes the PPO code

bin_pick.py
Hyperparameters and additional environment conditionings are done here. in particular the usage of sparse or dense reward will mainly be used 
to ensure the end effector stays still the block gripper is set to always be true
Distance goal is the acceptable distance the block can be away from and can be still considered a goal.


robot_env.py
Initialises all the data and gets the entire simulation prepared

fetch_env.py
Contains the action logic, step functions, environment setup function that is specific to the task, and reward calculation
